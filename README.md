There is only one script file run_analysis.R that performs the
course project.  Please unzip the dataset from the
getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip file into the working
directory.  Then run the run_analysis.R script to transform
the data into a tidy data set and create the summary file
summary.txt.  The CodeBook.md file summarizes the data files
and the processing done by the script.
